# Humanizer patterns: de lexicale AI-tells (voor/na)

Disclosed reference van de `humanizer`-skill. Pass 1 (lexicaal) loopt ELK genummerd patroon hieronder langs; de skill is pas klaar als elk patroon gecheckt is, niet als de opvallendste drie weg zijn. SKILL.md draagt het proces, de moderne structurele tells en de voice-calibratie; dit bestand draagt de patronen en het uitgewerkte voorbeeld. De em-dashes en curly quotes in de voorbeelden hieronder zijn quoted teaching-materiaal, geen eigen output.

## CONTENT PATTERNS

### 1. Undue Emphasis on Significance, Legacy, and Broader Trends

**Words to watch:** stands/serves as, is a testament/reminder, a vital/significant/crucial/pivotal/key role/moment, underscores/highlights its importance/significance, reflects broader, symbolizing its ongoing/enduring/lasting, contributing to the, setting the stage for, marking/shaping the, represents/marks a shift, key turning point, evolving landscape, focal point, indelible mark, deeply rooted

**Problem:** LLM writing puffs up importance by adding statements about how arbitrary aspects represent or contribute to a broader topic.

**Before:**
> The Statistical Institute of Catalonia was officially established in 1989, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of regional statistics in Spain. This initiative was part of a broader movement across Spain to decentralize administrative functions and enhance regional governance.

**After:**
> The Statistical Institute of Catalonia was established in 1989 to collect and publish regional statistics independently from Spain's national statistics office.


### 2. Undue Emphasis on Notability and Media Coverage

**Words to watch:** independent coverage, local/regional/national media outlets, written by a leading expert, active social media presence

**Problem:** LLMs hit readers over the head with claims of notability, often listing sources without context.

**Before:**
> Her views have been cited in The New York Times, BBC, Financial Times, and The Hindu. She maintains an active social media presence with over 500,000 followers.

**After:**
> In a 2024 New York Times interview, she argued that AI regulation should focus on outcomes rather than methods.


### 3. Superficial Analyses with -ing Endings

**Words to watch:** highlighting/underscoring/emphasizing..., ensuring..., reflecting/symbolizing..., contributing to..., cultivating/fostering..., encompassing..., showcasing...

**Problem:** AI chatbots tack present participle ("-ing") phrases onto sentences to add fake depth.

**Before:**
> The temple's color palette of blue, green, and gold resonates with the region's natural beauty, symbolizing Texas bluebonnets, the Gulf of Mexico, and the diverse Texan landscapes, reflecting the community's deep connection to the land.

**After:**
> The temple uses blue, green, and gold colors. The architect said these were chosen to reference local bluebonnets and the Gulf coast.


### 4. Promotional and Advertisement-like Language

**Words to watch:** boasts a, vibrant, rich (figurative), profound, enhancing its, showcasing, exemplifies, commitment to, natural beauty, nestled, in the heart of, groundbreaking (figurative), renowned, breathtaking, must-visit, stunning

**Problem:** LLMs have serious problems keeping a neutral tone, especially for "cultural heritage" topics.

**Before:**
> Nestled within the breathtaking region of Gonder in Ethiopia, Alamata Raya Kobo stands as a vibrant town with a rich cultural heritage and stunning natural beauty.

**After:**
> Alamata Raya Kobo is a town in the Gonder region of Ethiopia, known for its weekly market and 18th-century church.


### 5. Vague Attributions and Weasel Words

**Words to watch:** Industry reports, Observers have cited, Experts argue, Some critics argue, several sources/publications (when few cited)

**Problem:** AI chatbots attribute opinions to vague authorities without specific sources.

**Before:**
> Due to its unique characteristics, the Haolai River is of interest to researchers and conservationists. Experts believe it plays a crucial role in the regional ecosystem.

**After:**
> The Haolai River supports several endemic fish species, according to a 2019 survey by the Chinese Academy of Sciences.


### 6. Outline-like "Challenges and Future Prospects" Sections

**Words to watch:** Despite its... faces several challenges..., Despite these challenges, Challenges and Legacy, Future Outlook

**Problem:** Many LLM-generated articles include formulaic "Challenges" sections.

**Before:**
> Despite its industrial prosperity, Korattur faces challenges typical of urban areas, including traffic congestion and water scarcity. Despite these challenges, with its strategic location and ongoing initiatives, Korattur continues to thrive as an integral part of Chennai's growth.

**After:**
> Traffic congestion increased after 2015 when three new IT parks opened. The municipal corporation began a stormwater drainage project in 2022 to address recurring floods.


## LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR PATTERNS

### 7. Overused "AI Vocabulary" Words

**High-frequency AI words:** Actually, additionally, align with, crucial, delve, emphasizing, enduring, enhance, fostering, garner, highlight (verb), interplay, intricate/intricacies, key (adjective), landscape (abstract noun), pivotal, showcase, tapestry (abstract noun), testament, underscore (verb), valuable, vibrant

**Problem:** These words appear far more frequently in post-2023 text. They often co-occur.

**Before:**
> Additionally, a distinctive feature of Somali cuisine is the incorporation of camel meat. An enduring testament to Italian colonial influence is the widespread adoption of pasta in the local culinary landscape, showcasing how these dishes have integrated into the traditional diet.

**After:**
> Somali cuisine also includes camel meat, which is considered a delicacy. Pasta dishes, introduced during Italian colonization, remain common, especially in the south.


### 8. Avoidance of "is"/"are" (Copula Avoidance)

**Words to watch:** serves as/stands as/marks/represents [a], boasts/features/offers [a]

**Problem:** LLMs substitute elaborate constructions for simple copulas.

**Before:**
> Gallery 825 serves as LAAA's exhibition space for contemporary art. The gallery features four separate spaces and boasts over 3,000 square feet.

**After:**
> Gallery 825 is LAAA's exhibition space for contemporary art. The gallery has four rooms totaling 3,000 square feet.


### 9. Negative Parallelisms and Tailing Negations

**Problem:** Constructions like "Not only...but..." or "It's not just about..., it's..." are overused. So are clipped tailing-negation fragments such as "no guessing" or "no wasted motion" tacked onto the end of a sentence instead of written as a real clause.

**Before:**
> It's not just about the beat riding under the vocals; it's part of the aggression and atmosphere. It's not merely a song, it's a statement.

**After:**
> The heavy beat adds to the aggressive tone.

**Before (tailing negation):**
> The options come from the selected item, no guessing.

**After:**
> The options come from the selected item without forcing the user to guess.


### 10. Rule of Three Overuse

**Problem:** LLMs force ideas into groups of three to appear comprehensive.

**Before:**
> The event features keynote sessions, panel discussions, and networking opportunities. Attendees can expect innovation, inspiration, and industry insights.

**After:**
> The event includes talks and panels. There's also time for informal networking between sessions.


### 11. Elegant Variation (Synonym Cycling)

**Problem:** AI has repetition-penalty code causing excessive synonym substitution.

**Before:**
> The protagonist faces many challenges. The main character must overcome obstacles. The central figure eventually triumphs. The hero returns home.

**After:**
> The protagonist faces many challenges but eventually triumphs and returns home.


### 12. False Ranges

**Problem:** LLMs use "from X to Y" constructions where X and Y aren't on a meaningful scale.

**Before:**
> Our journey through the universe has taken us from the singularity of the Big Bang to the grand cosmic web, from the birth and death of stars to the enigmatic dance of dark matter.

**After:**
> The book covers the Big Bang, star formation, and current theories about dark matter.


### 13. Passive Voice and Subjectless Fragments

**Problem:** LLMs often hide the actor or drop the subject entirely with lines like "No configuration file needed" or "The results are preserved automatically." Rewrite these when active voice makes the sentence clearer and more direct.

**Before:**
> No configuration file needed. The results are preserved automatically.

**After:**
> You do not need a configuration file. The system preserves the results automatically.


## STYLE PATTERNS

### 14. Em Dash Overuse

**Problem:** LLMs use em dashes (—) more than humans, mimicking "punchy" sales writing. In practice, most of these can be rewritten more cleanly with commas, periods, or parentheses.

**Before:**
> The term is primarily promoted by Dutch institutions—not by the people themselves. You don't say "Netherlands, Europe" as an address—yet this mislabeling continues—even in official documents.

**After:**
> The term is primarily promoted by Dutch institutions, not by the people themselves. You don't say "Netherlands, Europe" as an address, yet this mislabeling continues in official documents.


### 15. Overuse of Boldface

**Problem:** AI chatbots emphasize phrases in boldface mechanically.

**Before:**
> It blends **OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)**, **KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)**, and visual strategy tools such as the **Business Model Canvas (BMC)** and **Balanced Scorecard (BSC)**.

**After:**
> It blends OKRs, KPIs, and visual strategy tools like the Business Model Canvas and Balanced Scorecard.


### 16. Inline-Header Vertical Lists

**Problem:** AI outputs lists where items start with bolded headers followed by colons.

**Before:**
> - **User Experience:** The user experience has been significantly improved with a new interface.
> - **Performance:** Performance has been enhanced through optimized algorithms.
> - **Security:** Security has been strengthened with end-to-end encryption.

**After:**
> The update improves the interface, speeds up load times through optimized algorithms, and adds end-to-end encryption.


### 17. Title Case in Headings

**Problem:** AI chatbots capitalize all main words in headings.

**Before:**
> ## Strategic Negotiations And Global Partnerships

**After:**
> ## Strategic negotiations and global partnerships


### 18. Emojis

**Problem:** AI chatbots often decorate headings or bullet points with emojis.

**Before:**
> 🚀 **Launch Phase:** The product launches in Q3
> 💡 **Key Insight:** Users prefer simplicity
> ✅ **Next Steps:** Schedule follow-up meeting

**After:**
> The product launches in Q3. User research showed a preference for simplicity. Next step: schedule a follow-up meeting.


### 19. Curly Quotation Marks

**Problem:** ChatGPT uses curly quotes (“...”) instead of straight quotes ("...").

**Before:**
> He said “the project is on track” but others disagreed.

**After:**
> He said "the project is on track" but others disagreed.


## COMMUNICATION PATTERNS

### 20. Collaborative Communication Artifacts

**Words to watch:** I hope this helps, Of course!, Certainly!, You're absolutely right!, Would you like..., let me know, here is a...

**Problem:** Text meant as chatbot correspondence gets pasted as content.

**Before:**
> Here is an overview of the French Revolution. I hope this helps! Let me know if you'd like me to expand on any section.

**After:**
> The French Revolution began in 1789 when financial crisis and food shortages led to widespread unrest.


### 21. Knowledge-Cutoff Disclaimers

**Words to watch:** as of [date], Up to my last training update, While specific details are limited/scarce..., based on available information...

**Problem:** AI disclaimers about incomplete information get left in text.

**Before:**
> While specific details about the company's founding are not extensively documented in readily available sources, it appears to have been established sometime in the 1990s.

**After:**
> The company was founded in 1994, according to its registration documents.


### 22. Sycophantic/Servile Tone

**Problem:** Overly positive, people-pleasing language.

**Before:**
> Great question! You're absolutely right that this is a complex topic. That's an excellent point about the economic factors.

**After:**
> The economic factors you mentioned are relevant here.


## FILLER AND HEDGING

### 23. Filler Phrases

**Before → After:**
- "In order to achieve this goal" → "To achieve this"
- "Due to the fact that it was raining" → "Because it was raining"
- "At this point in time" → "Now"
- "In the event that you need help" → "If you need help"
- "The system has the ability to process" → "The system can process"
- "It is important to note that the data shows" → "The data shows"


### 24. Excessive Hedging

**Problem:** Over-qualifying statements.

**Before:**
> It could potentially possibly be argued that the policy might have some effect on outcomes.

**After:**
> The policy may affect outcomes.


### 25. Generic Positive Conclusions

**Problem:** Vague upbeat endings.

**Before:**
> The future looks bright for the company. Exciting times lie ahead as they continue their journey toward excellence. This represents a major step in the right direction.

**After:**
> The company plans to open two more locations next year.


### 26. Hyphenated Word Pair Overuse

**Words to watch:** third-party, cross-functional, client-facing, data-driven, decision-making, well-known, high-quality, real-time, long-term, end-to-end

**Problem:** AI hyphenates common word pairs with perfect consistency. Humans rarely hyphenate these uniformly, and when they do, it's inconsistent. Less common or technical compound modifiers are fine to hyphenate.

**Before:**
> The cross-functional team delivered a high-quality, data-driven report on our client-facing tools. Their decision-making process was well-known for being thorough and detail-oriented.

**After:**
> The cross functional team delivered a high quality, data driven report on our client facing tools. Their decision making process was known for being thorough and detail oriented.


### 27. Persuasive Authority Tropes

**Phrases to watch:** The real question is, at its core, in reality, what really matters, fundamentally, the deeper issue, the heart of the matter

**Problem:** LLMs use these phrases to pretend they are cutting through noise to some deeper truth, when the sentence that follows usually just restates an ordinary point with extra ceremony.

**Before:**
> The real question is whether teams can adapt. At its core, what really matters is organizational readiness.

**After:**
> The question is whether teams can adapt. That mostly depends on whether the organization is ready to change its habits.


### 28. Signposting and Announcements

**Phrases to watch:** Let's dive in, let's explore, let's break this down, here's what you need to know, now let's look at, without further ado

**Problem:** LLMs announce what they are about to do instead of doing it. This meta-commentary slows the writing down and gives it a tutorial-script feel.

**Before:**
> Let's dive into how caching works in Next.js. Here's what you need to know.

**After:**
> Next.js caches data at multiple layers, including request memoization, the data cache, and the router cache.


### 29. Fragmented Headers

**Signs to watch:** A heading followed by a one-line paragraph that simply restates the heading before the real content begins.

**Problem:** LLMs often add a generic sentence after a heading as a rhetorical warm-up. It usually adds nothing and makes the prose feel padded.

**Before:**
> ## Performance
>
> Speed matters.
>
> When users hit a slow page, they leave.

**After:**
> ## Performance
>
> When users hit a slow page, they leave.

## NON-ENGLISH: TRANSLATION ARTEFACTS (Dutch)

Models are trained overwhelmingly on English. A Dutch prompt is processed through English patterns and rendered back, so most Dutch AI tells are **English structure wearing Dutch words**. These are language facts, not style preferences: a Dutch professional would not write them either way. Patterns 1-29 still apply on top of these.

### 30. Gedachtestreepje op z'n Engels

**Signs to watch:** A dash used mid-sentence as emphasis or a dramatic pivot, the way English uses the em dash.

**Problem:** In Dutch the gedachtestreepje marks off an interjected clause and comes in pairs, or it introduces a summary. Used as a single dramatic beat it is a straight import from English. This is the em dash tell (pattern 14) in disguise, and it survives translation because the writer only swapped the words.

**Before:**
> `De agent bouwt zelfstandig verder — en dat is precies het probleem.`

**After:**
> `De agent bouwt zelfstandig verder, en dat is precies het probleem.`

### 31. Oxford-komma voor "en"

**Signs to watch:** A comma before `en` or `of` in an enumeration: `appels, peren, en bananen`.

**Problem:** Not standard Dutch punctuation. It appears because the English serial comma leaks through. On its own it is weak evidence, but in a cluster it is a fingerprint.

**Before:**
> `We gebruiken Docker, Postgres, en Redis.`

**After:**
> `We gebruiken Docker, Postgres en Redis.`

### 32. Titlecase in Nederlandse koppen

**Signs to watch:** `De Voordelen Van Automatisering`, every content word capitalized.

**Problem:** Dutch uses sentence case in headings. Title case is an English convention that models apply reflexively. Same tell as pattern 17, but it survives a translation pass and is therefore more common in Dutch output than in English output.

**Before:**
> `## De Voordelen Van Slimme Automatisering`

**After:**
> `## De voordelen van slimme automatisering`

### 33. Vertaalreflex-woordenschat

**Signs to watch:** `cruciaal`, `diepgaand`, `benutten`, `ontgrendelen`, `in staat stellen`, `mogelijk maken`, `naadloos`, `robuust`, `ecosysteem`, `essentieel`.

**Problem:** These are one-to-one renderings of `crucial`, `in-depth`, `leverage`, `unlock`, `enable`, `seamless`, `robust`. Each is a real Dutch word, which is why they slip past. The tell is that a Dutch writer would reach for a shorter, blunter one: `belangrijk`, `grondig`, `gebruiken`, `zorgt dat`. Look at frequency, not the single word: one `cruciaal` is normal, three in a page is a translation.

**Before:**
> `Deze cruciale tool stelt teams in staat om hun workflow naadloos te optimaliseren.`

**After:**
> `Met deze tool ruimen teams hun workflow op.`

### 34. Holle Nederlandse openers

**Signs to watch:** `in de snel veranderende wereld van`, `in het huidige digitale landschap`, `het is belangrijker dan ooit om`, `in een tijd waarin`.

**Problem:** Direct calques of `in today's rapidly evolving landscape`. They say nothing, they delay the first real sentence, and no Dutch professional opens a mail or a post this way. Delete and start at the point.

**Before:**
> `In het huidige digitale landschap is het belangrijker dan ooit om je data op orde te hebben.`

**After:**
> `Je data staat op vier plekken en niemand weet welke klopt.`

### 35. Geimporteerd clickbait-register

**Signs to watch:** `Superchargeer je online aanwezigheid`, `Ontdek hoe je ... kunt transformeren`, `Klaar om je X naar het volgende niveau te tillen?`, English verbs with a Dutch conjugation glued on.

**Problem:** American marketing register mapped onto Dutch. Dutch professional norms are flatter and more understated, so the register itself reads as machine-made regardless of the individual words. Also the source of half-translated verbs (`superchargeer`, `optimaliseer je funnel`) that exist in no Dutch dictionary.

**Before:**
> `Klaar om je recruitmentproces naar het volgende niveau te tillen? Ontdek hoe AI jouw workflow kan transformeren!`

**After:**
> `Twee van de acht stappen in het recruitmentproces kosten samen 60% van de tijd. Die twee zijn te automatiseren.`

## HUMAN-EDITOR PATTERNS

Derived from side-by-side comparison of AI drafts against a professional human editor's rewrites (formal B2B web copy, 2026-07). These are the changes a real editor makes that no word list catches.

### 36. Staccato Fragment Chains

**Signs to watch:** three noun fragments as a sentence, a colon followed by a comma-list of clipped phrases (`For lenders that means: strong collateral, sharp rates, high LTVs.`)

**Problem:** LLMs simulate punch by chopping prose into fragments. Human professional writing runs on full sentences that flow into each other with connectives (`therefore`, `by contrast`, `which is why`). The fragment chain is now a stronger AI tell than any single word.

**Before:**
> Different ratios, different lenders, different risks. For financiers that means: sought-after collateral, sharp rates, high LTVs possible.

**After:**
> Different ratios apply, the risks are different and other lenders are active in this market. Financiers regard it as sought-after collateral, which is why sharp rates and high LTVs are often available.


### 37. Register-Mismatched Metaphors

**Signs to watch:** `the darling of`, `comes in two flavors`, `a killer feature`, `sweet spot` in formal or institutional copy

**Problem:** Casual metaphors that read fine in a blog leak into formal documents, where a professional editor strikes them on sight. The register mismatch, not the metaphor itself, is the tell.

**Before:**
> Distribution centers have become the darling of institutional investors. The market comes in two flavors: banks and funds.

**After:**
> Distribution centers have become one of the preferred asset types of institutional investors. The market has two kinds of players: banks and funds.


### 38. Ungrounded Absolutes

**Signs to watch:** `the most important`, `the key factor`, `must`, `always`, `the single biggest`

**Problem:** LLMs state superlatives and absolutes that the facts do not support and a domain expert would never sign. The human fix is a small qualifier, not a hedge-pile: `one of the`, `largely`, `in most cases`.

**Before:**
> The rental income is the most important security for the lender. The property must pay for itself.

**After:**
> The rental income is one of the most important factors the lender assesses. The property must largely pay for itself.


### 39. Sections as Islands (No Back-References)

**Problem:** LLMs write each section as a self-contained block, so long pages read as stacked fragments instead of one argument. Human writers stitch sections together by referring back to earlier material (`as you read earlier`, `this is the same mechanism as in step 2`).

**Before:**
> Sustainability has shifted from side issue to acceptance criterion. For offices larger than 100 square meters, label C has been a legal requirement since 2023.

**After:**
> Sustainability has shifted from side issue to acceptance criterion. As you read earlier, label C has been the legal requirement for offices larger than 100 square meters since 2023.


### 40. Example Churn

**Problem:** LLMs invent a fresh example for every section, which wastes the reader's working memory and breaks cohesion. A human editor reuses one established example across the page (the same tenant, the same building, the same figures) so later sections build on earlier ones. Related: examples should be sized to the audience; a listed multinational is a worse example for SME readers than a national chain.

**Before:**
> (section 3) A publicly listed retailer as tenant gives more certainty. (section 7, new example) Consider a pharmaceutical company leasing a laboratory.

**After:**
> (section 3) A national chain as tenant gives more certainty. (section 7, same example) Take the national chain from earlier: if it leaves, the unit re-lets quickly.

### 41. Colon Reveals

**Problem:** A noun phrase, a colon, then a lowercase dramatic reveal. It manufactures suspense for a fact that needed none. Colons are for lists, labels and quotes, not for a drumroll.

**Before:**
> The detail that makes it work: a separate agent grades the output. The best part: it learns.

**After:**
> A separate agent grades the output, which is what makes it work. It learns as it goes.


### 42. Faux-Insight Setups

**Problem:** `What most people get wrong`, `here's what nobody tells you`, `the part everyone misses`, `wat de meeste mensen niet weten`. The setup flatters the writer as the lone expert and adds nothing. Cut it, let the claim stand alone.

**Before:**
> The part everyone misses: distribution is the real moat.

**After:**
> Distribution is the moat.


### 43. Superficial -ing Analysis

**Problem:** A trailing `-ing` clause that pretends to explain what something means: `highlighting`, `underscoring`, `reflecting`, `showcasing`, `demonstrating`, `benadrukkend`. It reads as analysis but states nothing checkable. Replace it with the consequence, or cut it.

**Before:**
> The launch adds file search, highlighting the team's commitment to better workflows.

**After:**
> The launch adds file search, so users find old drafts without leaving the editor.


### 44. Fake-Strong Verbs

**Problem:** A weak fact dressed in an important-sounding verb phrase: `serves as a centralized hub for`, `plays a key role in`, `fungeert als`, `made a decision`, `has the ability to`. Prefer `is`, `has`, `can`, or the plain verb. Related to 8 (copula avoidance), but here the fix is naming what the thing actually does.

**Before:**
> The app serves as a centralized hub for sponsor management and has the ability to generate reports.

**After:**
> The app tracks sponsors, deadlines and approvals in one place, and it exports a report.


### 45. The Fake-Profound Kicker

**Problem:** The closing "deep" line that turns a concrete piece into an aphorism or mic-drop metaphor. `And that, in the end, is what building really means.` / `De rest is ruis.`

**Fix: delete it.** Do not rewrite it into a better metaphor, do not preserve its rhythm. End on the clearest concrete sentence already in the draft, or on a plain takeaway or next action. Same for summary-recap endings (`In conclusion`, `Kortom`): the reader was just there.


### 46. Decorative Formatting

**Problem:** Format used as decoration rather than structure: emoji in headings, bold sprinkled mid-sentence for emphasis, a bullet list where two sentences of prose read better, a header over a two-sentence section. Related to 15, 16 and 18; the test here is whether removing the formatting loses any information. If not, remove it.

**Before:**
> **The key insight** is that reviews are slow. 🚀
> - they queue
> - nobody owns them

**After:**
> Reviews are slow because they queue and nobody owns them.

## Full Example

**Before (AI-sounding):**
> Great question! Here is an essay on this topic. I hope this helps!
>
> AI-assisted coding serves as an enduring testament to the transformative potential of large language models, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of software development. In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, these groundbreaking tools—nestled at the intersection of research and practice—are reshaping how engineers ideate, iterate, and deliver, underscoring their vital role in modern workflows.
>
> At its core, the value proposition is clear: streamlining processes, enhancing collaboration, and fostering alignment. It's not just about autocomplete; it's about unlocking creativity at scale, ensuring that organizations can remain agile while delivering seamless, intuitive, and powerful experiences to users. The tool serves as a catalyst. The assistant functions as a partner. The system stands as a foundation for innovation.
>
> Industry observers have noted that adoption has accelerated from hobbyist experiments to enterprise-wide rollouts, from solo developers to cross-functional teams. The technology has been featured in The New York Times, Wired, and The Verge. Additionally, the ability to generate documentation, tests, and refactors showcases how AI can contribute to better outcomes, highlighting the intricate interplay between automation and human judgment.
>
> - 💡 **Speed:** Code generation is significantly faster, reducing friction and empowering developers.
> - 🚀 **Quality:** Output quality has been enhanced through improved training, contributing to higher standards.
> - ✅ **Adoption:** Usage continues to grow, reflecting broader industry trends.
>
> While specific details are limited based on available information, it could potentially be argued that these tools might have some positive effect. Despite challenges typical of emerging technologies—including hallucinations, bias, and accountability—the ecosystem continues to thrive. In order to fully realize this potential, teams must align with best practices.
>
> In conclusion, the future looks bright. Exciting times lie ahead as we continue this journey toward excellence. Let me know if you’d like me to expand on any section!

**Draft rewrite:**
> AI coding assistants speed up some tasks. In a 2024 study by Google, developers using Codex completed simple functions 55% faster than a control group, but showed no improvement on debugging or architectural decisions.
>
> The tools are good at boilerplate: config files, test scaffolding, repetitive refactors. They are bad at knowing when they are wrong. I have mass-accepted suggestions that compiled, passed lint, and still did the wrong thing because I stopped paying attention.
>
> Mira, an engineer at a fintech startup I interviewed, said she uses Copilot "like autocomplete for boring code" but reviews every line before committing. Jake, a senior dev at a larger company, disabled it after it kept suggesting patterns from a deprecated internal library.
>
> The productivity claims are hard to verify. GitHub says Copilot users "accept 30% of suggestions," but acceptance is not correctness, and correctness is not value. The 2024 Uplevel study found no statistically significant difference in pull-request throughput between teams with and without AI assistants.
>
> None of this means the tools are useless. It means they are tools. They do not replace judgment, and they do not eliminate the need for tests. If you do not have tests, you cannot tell whether the suggestion is right.

**What makes the below so obviously AI generated?**
- The rhythm is still a bit too tidy (clean contrasts, evenly paced paragraphs).
- The named people and study citations can read like plausible-but-made-up placeholders unless they're real and sourced.
- The closer leans a touch slogan-y ("If you do not have tests...") rather than sounding like a person talking.

**Now make it not obviously AI generated.**
> AI coding assistants can make you faster at the boring parts. Not everything. Definitely not architecture.
>
> They're great at boilerplate: config files, test scaffolding, repetitive refactors. They're also great at sounding right while being wrong. I've accepted suggestions that compiled, passed lint, and still missed the point because I stopped paying attention.
>
> People I talk to tend to land in two camps. Some use it like autocomplete for chores and review every line. Others disable it after it keeps suggesting patterns they don't want. Both feel reasonable.
>
> The productivity metrics are slippery. GitHub can say Copilot users "accept 30% of suggestions," but acceptance isn't correctness, and correctness isn't value. If you don't have tests, you're basically guessing.
